# mini-os-test
A test "Operating System" with minimal bootstrap, a VGA Color terminal, and an infinite loop.


Big thanks to the folks over at OSDev.org for the NASM "bare bones" tutorial.



This is not a major project. This is simply a proof-of-concept and demonstration of basic NASM Assembly skills.

Currently runs as an RockRidge ISO image in GNU Boxes through GRUB without problem on Ubunutu 20.04.
